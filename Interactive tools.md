airGRteaching is an add-on package to the airGR package. It simplifies its use and is more specifically oriented towards teaching than airGR. It provides access to the GR rainfall-runoff models (GR4H, GR4J, GR5J, GR6J, GR2M, GR1A) and a snow melt and accumulation model (CemaNeige) with limited programming skills. This package also provides a graphical interface to help students exploring data and model results.
