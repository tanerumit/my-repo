  e2o_downscaling-tools consists of a number of python programs and procedures that facilitate local application of the earth2observe global water resources reanalysis (http://www.earth2observe.eu). The tools can connect directly to the projectâ€™s data server (http://wci.earth2observe.eu) and save (resampled) data to a local computer for further analysis or direct application. The current first versions of the tool focusses on downscaling the global forcing dataset used in the project.
