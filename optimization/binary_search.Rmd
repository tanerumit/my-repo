## Binary Search Algorithm

- **_Binary search_** is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from an ordered 
  list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the 
  list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible 
  locations to just one.

## Binary Search Algorithm

* Assume that:
    + X is a continuous variable
    + Y is a function of X, i.e., Y = F(x)
    + a, b are the lower and upper bounds of X

## Binary Search in R (1)

>- Define Y = F(X)
>- Define the target value for Y
>- Define the lower & upper bounds for X
>- Define max.iteration number
>- Repeat search until the target Y is obtained

## Binary Search in R(2)

```{r, eval = FALSE, tidy = TRUE}

    #Define F(X)
    Y_calculate <- function(X) {}  

    #Target Y value
    target_Y <- "input_target_value_here"

    #Boundary conditions
    min_X <- "lower_bound_for_the_search"
    max_X <- "upper_bound_for_the_search"
    
    #Max.number of iteraton
    max.iterations <- "input_max_iterations_here"

```  

## Binary Search in R (3)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
    i <- 0
    repeat {
      #Current iteration
      i <- i + 1
      #Current value of X
      mid_X <- (min_X + max_X)/2
      #Current value of Y
      Y <- Y_calculate(mid_X)
      #Set the new upper & lower bounds
      if (Y > Y_target) min_X <- mid_X
      if (Y < Y_target) max_X <- mid_X
      #Stop if the target is achieved
      if (round(Y, 3) == Y_target) break
      #Stop if max. number of iterations is reached
      if (i >= max.iterations) break
    }
```
